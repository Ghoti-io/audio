"""Fail if anything a test reads is excluded from the repository.

    make check-fixtures

**The failure this exists for leaves `git status` clean.** A `.gitignore` rule
written for build output also matches an input: a blanket `*` with a negation per
directory stops negating the moment a directory is added, because an excluded
*directory* blocks every negation inside it. The files then work perfectly in the
tree where they were written and are absent from every clone, and nothing says so -
the suite goes red on someone else's machine, for a reason that looks like a broken
checkout.

It has happened twice in this workspace: `regex` lost half of what one of its gates
measured against, and this library's third fuzz harness was added with its seed
directory excluded. The gate is cheap because the question is cheap: git will
answer it per path.

What counts as an input: the committed corpus under `tests/data/`, and the fuzz
seeds under `tests/fuzz/corpus/`. Everything the fuzzer *writes* beside those seeds
is output and is meant to be ignored, so the check is that each input is **either
tracked or trackable**, not that everything present is tracked.
