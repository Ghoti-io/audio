"""How an oracle is spelled, so that no tool here spells one itself.

Copied from the archive library's oracle_env.py, itself from security's and
font's, which is the built-here shape: the image has no upstream digest, so
check_pin() runs in both modes and the version the reference prints is the
guarantee. A probe that exits non-zero is a failure even if its stdout happens
to contain the expected text - an oracle that accepts a crashed probe because
the banner looked right is not a pin. What changed here is the probe table.

`command("ffmpeg")` returns the argv prefix that runs the reference, which is
`docker run` into the image built by `containers/refs/Containerfile`.

Every reference shares one image, so `command()` returns the same `docker run`
for all of them - the name selects the *program*, not the image. That is
deliberate (containers/IMAGES): these are four independent implementations
asked the same question about the same file, and the whole value is in where
they disagree, which is only a fact about them if their base state is one
fact.

Three of the names are not programs. `libsndfile`, `pywave` and `mutagen` are
all `python3`, and they are separate entries because they are separate
implementations: libsndfile is a C library with its own parsers, `wave` is a
pure-Python parser in the standard library that shares no code with it, and
mutagen is a pure-Python tag library that reads no samples at all. A
pin saying "python3 3.13.5" would be one fact where the corpus asks two
questions.

Note that Python 3.13 REMOVED `aifc` (PEP 594), so there is no stdlib AIFF
reader any more and `pywave` answers about WAV only. AIFF's three references
are ffmpeg, sox and libsndfile.

Modes, from GHOTI_ORACLE_MODE:

  container  (default) run the reference in its pinned image
  host                 run a binary of the same name on this machine, and
                       still require it to report the pinned version
