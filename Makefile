# Two flags beyond the suite's shared set, both carried because the suite
# measured what they catch and neither is a nicety.
#
# -Wfloat-conversion is not in -Wall or -Wextra, and catches an *implicit*
# float-to-integer conversion - a double handed to an integer parameter, where
# no cast appears in the source and a grep for "(int32_t)" finds nothing.
# Ghoti.io Tang had one: a float literal passed into a pool keyed by an
# unsigned integer, so 1.5 and 1.0 shared a key. The two instruments do not
# overlap - an explicit cast silences this and is caught at runtime by
# float-cast-overflow instead, and an implicit conversion of an in-range value
# is a wrong answer no sanitizer reports.
#
# -Wstrict-aliasing=1 with -fstrict-aliasing is the suite's only instrument for
# the aliasing class. **No sanitizer reports a strict-aliasing violation at any
# -O**, measured on a minimal pair in model where gcc miscompiles and both
# ASan and UBSan print nothing and exit 0. So this compile-time check is not a
# second opinion on the runtime gates; it is the only opinion.
#
# Three things about the spelling, each of which has bitten somebody:
#
# - **-Wall sets the level to 3 on its own, and 3 is silent** on the plain
#   type-punned dereference that level 1 rejects. So a library at -O2 with
#   `-Wall -Werror` and no level named has the aliasing *optimisation* armed
#   and no warning behind it, which reads from the flag list exactly like a
#   library that is covered. An explicit level beats -Wall's implicit 3 from
#   either side, so the ordering on this line is not load-bearing; a *later*
#   explicit level does beat it, and $(EXTRA_CFLAGS) is last.
# - **-fstrict-aliasing is named because the warning is silent without it**,
#   and gcc enables it only from -O2. Unnamed, the check would be live in the
#   release tree and silently inert in every other tree CFLAGS reaches - the
#   coverage tree, which appends its own -O0, and BUILD=debug.
# - Naming it turns the aliasing *assumption* on where gcc had it off, which is
#   a real change and not only a warning. Whether that changes any codegen is a
#   per-library measurement, not something to inherit: model's 9 objects are
#   instruction-identical with and without it at -O0 and -O1 and differ at -O2.
#   `make check-codegen-aliasing` is not a target here; the way to ask is to
#   compare `objdump -d` output, never whole-object md5, because debug info
#   records the command line and so every object differs whether or not any
#   code does.
#
# The fuzz tree does not read CFLAGS - it builds with clang, at -O1 and with
# -w - and clang implements nothing for -Wstrict-aliasing in any case, so the
# fuzz tree is not a warning gate and under clang this library has no aliasing
# instrument at all. FUZZ_SAN names -fstrict-aliasing separately so its codegen
# assumption is stated rather than inherited.
#
# Building the debug tree needs one flag, because BRANCH becomes `-debug` and
# CUTIL_PC is derived from it, so pkg-config is asked for a ghoti.io-cutil-debug
# that only a whole-suite debug bootstrap installs. Override the name and a

# not named in Requires, because as of phase 4 nothing in this library uses it.
#
# It was a hard dependency from phase 0 for two cases that both turned out not
# to need it yet. ID3v2.3/2.4 frames carry a compression flag and this library
# *declines* those frames - it keeps them raw, with their flags, because a frame
# it cannot read is still one it must not lose (src/meta/id3_read.c). Matroska's
# ContentCompression is phase 9. No codec needs it either: FLAC is Rice coding
# over fixed predictors and owes deflate nothing.
#
# What that cost is narrower than it looks, and worth stating exactly, because
# the obvious complaint - "every consumer links a library for nothing" - was not
# true. The archive referenced no symbol of it, so the linker's default
# --as-needed had already kept it out of the shared object's DT_NEEDED. The real
# cost was one line: `Requires: ghoti.io-compress` in the .pc, which makes it a
# hard BUILD-time requirement for anything that so much as compiles against this
# library. planning/audio.md 9 records the decision and that measurement.
#
# The commit that adds the first real caller adds the detection, the link, a
# -DGAUD_HAVE_COMPRESS=1 and the capability accessor together, in the shape the
# ghoti.io-image block below already has. Putting the plumbing in now instead
# would leave a feature define nothing reads and an #ifdef arm nothing compiles,
# which is the half that rots unnoticed.

# ghoti.io-security, for MD5. FLAC's STREAMINFO carries an MD5 of the
# unencoded audio, and that one field is the reason this dependency exists.
#
# It is not a hash used as a hash here. It is a whole-decoder self-check the
# format hands over for free: after decoding a file we can compute the digest
# of what came out and compare it with what the encoder recorded, which scores
# every subframe type, every predictor order and every stereo mode at once
# against a number written by a different implementation. No test this library
# could write covers as much. On the writing side it is mandatory in practice
# rather than in the specification - RFC 9639 allows an all-zero signature, and
# a file carrying one makes `flac -t` print that it cannot verify, which would
# leave the plan's strongest gate (planning/audio.md 12, class 1) measuring
# nothing.
#
# The alternative was a private MD5 in this library, and it was rejected: the
# suite has a security library precisely so that nobody writes a second one,
# and a second implementation is a second thing to get wrong in a place where
# being wrong looks like a decoder defect. security is line 2 of

# a race rather than a clean failure.
#
# This was inherited. `archive`, the Makefile this was copied from, has it on
# the release rule alone, so `make test-asan` there fails on a clean tree.
# CONVENTIONS.md section 12 warns that copying a Makefile copies its defects;
# this is that, caught by building the ASan tree before anything else.

# libver_gen.h is regenerated on every build and rewritten only when its content

# What each reference can and cannot see:

#   ffmpeg      libavformat's RIFF and IFF demuxers. The most widely
#               deployed reader of both formats, and the practical
#               definition of "this file works".
#   sox         A separate lineage, sharing no code with ffmpeg. NOT an
#               exact reference for float samples - it routes them through
#               its own 32-bit fixed-point representation and loses the last
#               bits - which check_corpus.py states as a measured exclusion
#               rather than skipping quietly.
#   libsndfile  The third parser, and the one most non-ffmpeg audio software
#               actually uses. Widens u8/s8 and s24 on the way out, so it is
#               compared byte-for-byte only for the widths it keeps.
#   pywave      The standard library's `wave`: a fourth, pure-Python reading
#               that shares nothing with the three C parsers. WAV only, and
#               integer WAV at that - Python 3.13 removed `aifc` under PEP
#               594, so AIFF has three references rather than four.
#
# The corpus is generated BY the references, never by this library. A corpus
# grown from our own writer would agree with our own reader by construction

# The cross-architecture golden gate
####################################################################
#
# planning/audio.md 11.1 promises byte-identical samples on every platform.
# On one machine that promise is unfalsifiable, so this builds the library
# for big-endian targets in the workspace's cross container and requires the
# corpus to decode to the same values.
#
# **This earns its place in phase 1 rather than waiting for the fixed-point
# decoders in phase 5.** WAV is little-endian and AIFF is big-endian, so each
# codec's byte-swapping runs on exactly the inputs the other's does not:
#
#     on x86-64 (little)   WAV: no swap     AIFF: swap
#     on s390x  (big)      WAV: swap        AIFF: no swap
#
# Every swap path here is dead code on one of the two, and a gate that ran
# only on this host would leave half of them never executed. That is why
# AIFF is in phase 1 beside WAV at all.
#
# Not in TEST_GATES: it needs the cross container, and `make test` must not.

check-aliasing: ## Fail if the strict-aliasing warning is not actually armed
# CFLAGS names -fstrict-aliasing and -Wstrict-aliasing=1, and neither spelling
# tells you the level that results. -Wall sets the level to 3 on its own, an
# explicit level beats it from either side, and a later explicit level beats
# that - so the resolved level depends on the whole command line, and
# $(EXTRA_CFLAGS) sits at the end of it. `make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-Wstrict-aliasing=3`
# builds this library with the aliasing optimisation armed and the warning
# silent, every flag still present and every comment about them still true.
#
# So ask the compiler instead of the flag list: compile a violation with the
# real $(CFLAGS) and require the diagnostic. That reads the level the command
# line resolves to, which no review of the spelling can do. The design is the
# chron session's, and the measurements below are the chron, model and image
# sessions' - reproduced here by this gate passing, not re-derived.
#
# ---- Do not simplify the probe. Its shape is what makes it discriminating.
#
# The probe pins the level at exactly 1: level 1 reports this shape, and 0, 2
# and 3 are all silent on it. Diagnostics at -O2, counted across five violation
# shapes:
#
#                                                      L0  L1  L2  L3
#   cast of a pointer PARAMETER      <- this probe       0   1   0   0
#   struct-to-struct cast of a parameter                 0   1   0   0
#   a void * stored through a typed lvalue               0   1   1   0
#   *(int *)&local, *(long *)&s->member                  0   2   2   2
#   laundered through a `void * v = p` variable          0   0   0   0
#
# Written the obvious way, `*(int *)&local`, this gate would pass with the
# warning at level 3 and certify nothing - row four is reported at every level
# from 1 up. A later tidy-up that "simplifies" the probe therefore silently
# removes the only thing it measures. Measured in model rather than argued:
# with the probe rewritten that way, `make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-Wstrict-aliasing=3
# check-aliasing` exits 0 - the one case the gate exists to catch, passing
# green.
#
# Two axes decide those rows, and they matter if this library ever moves off
# level 1. Taking the address of an object the compiler can see is what level 2
# needs; routing the cast through a separate pointer variable is what defeats
# level 3. So this probe certifies level 1 and **would be vacuous at level 2**:
# green, asserting nothing. A gate meant to certify "1 or 2, but not 3" needs a
# known object reached through a variable instead.
#
# Two limits bound what a green run may be said to mean. Level 3 is not blind
# in general - it catches row four - so a sibling library sitting at 3 is not
# uninstrumented, it is blind to rows one to three. And **nothing catches row
# five at any level**, including 1: a clean run here is not evidence about
# punning laundered through a void * variable, which is the spelling real code
# reaches for most readily.
#
# So a silent probe has three different causes and they want opposite fixes,
# which is why the failure branch *measures* the cause rather than naming the
# likeliest one. A gate whose diagnosis is one step off sends the next reader
# after something that is not wrong, and they will trust it because the gate was
# right to fire:
#
#   $(CC) reports no level at all   a compiler that accepts the option and
#                                   implements nothing. clang does this, so
#                                   under clang there is no instrument here -
#                                   and no sanitizer covers the class either.
#   $(CC) reports 0, 2 or 3         the level is wrong; the flags are present.
#                                   3 is also what -Wall implies, so it is an
#                                   override or a removal and this cannot say
#                                   which - it says so rather than guessing.
#   $(CC) reports 1                 the level is right and it still did not
#                                   fire, which nothing here explains. Suspect

# Sanitizer build (ASan + UBSan): separate build dir, run the test suite
####################################################################
# -fno-sanitize-recover: without it UBSan PRINTS a diagnostic and carries on,
# so the process still exits 0 and the suite reports clean over undefined
# behaviour it just described. A gate that cannot fail is not a gate.
#
# float-cast-overflow is named separately because GCC does NOT put it in the
# `undefined` group - and so `-fno-sanitize-recover=undefined` does not reach
# it either. Measured: a cast of 1e30 to int under `-fsanitize=undefined
# -fno-sanitize-recover=undefined` printed nothing and exited 0, and with this
# flag it reports. Converting a float that does not fit is undefined
# behaviour. Nothing here converts a float today - every field of every
# container this library will read is an integer - so the flag is carried
# because it costs nothing and fails the build the day that stops being true,
# rather than because it is watching something. The same reasoning does not
# extend to float-divide-by-zero, which IEEE defines.
UBSAN_CHECKS := undefined,float-cast-overflow
# The gate's own -O, pinned rather than inherited. ASAN_CFLAGS starts from
# $(CFLAGS), so without this the sanitizer tree silently tracks the release
# level - it is -O2 today because the release build is, and it would become
# -O3 the day that did, with nobody deciding it.
#
# The argument for inheriting is that strict-aliasing and signed-overflow
# assumptions are inert at -O0 and live at -O2, so a UB gate should run at the
# level that ships. That is true about the *optimiser* and says nothing about
# what the *sanitizer sees*, and the two weld into one sentence very easily.
# The text session made that argument, measured it, and withdrew it; model
# re-measured on its own ASAN_CFLAGS rather than copying the table, one defect
# per program so that halting at the first finding cannot hide a later one:
#
#                          -O1         -O2
#   heap-use-after-free    caught      caught
#   heap-buffer-overflow   caught      caught
#   stack-buffer-overflow  caught      caught
#   use-after-scope        caught      caught
#   signed overflow        caught      caught
#   float-cast overflow    caught      caught
#   strict aliasing        NOT caught  NOT caught
#
# Nothing the sanitizer can see depends on the level, so inheriting never
# bought the coverage the argument implied. The last row is the one that
# decides it: aliasing is the hazard the argument names, and no sanitizer in
# this toolchain reports it at any level - check-aliasing exists because of
# that, and it is where that class has to be caught.
#
# use-after-scope was in that table because the optimiser can dissolve the
# scope it depends on; it did not differ either.
#
# What pinning buys here. FUZZ_SAN is -O1, so the gate and the fuzzers share
# one codegen and a fuzz artifact reproduces under test-asan without a level
# change in between. And the gate stops moving silently when the release level
# moves.
#
# For a trace that needs reading, `make test-asan BUILD=debug
# CUTIL_PC=ghoti.io-cutil-0` gives -O0. Trace quality is NOT the argument
# here: text measured the reports identical frame for frame and did not claim
# it, and neither does this.

# same object**. What that produced was an ASan heap-buffer-overflow eight bytes
# past the archive, in code that was correct - reader.c's object still had the

# That is the most expensive shape a gate can have: a finding that is real, is

coverage: ## Build instrumented, run the tests, and report line coverage
# The instrumented build has a tree of its own, the way the sanitizer builds

# runs the instrumented build by hand instead of through this target.
#
# What happens then is worth spelling out, because the obvious check says the
# tree is fine. The --coverage objects stay behind carrying undefined
# __gcov_* references, but the .so built alongside them was linked WITH
# --coverage, so it resolves them and `nm -D --undefined-only` reports it
# clean. Nothing looks wrong. The contamination is latent in the objects: a
# later plain `make` finds them newer than their sources, does not rebuild
# them, and the first time it has any reason to RELINK it produces a .so with
# three undefined gcov symbols. bootstrap.sh installs that, and every
# downstream library fails to link.
#
# That happened in the workspace, to a sibling. It broke the shared prefix for
# every library and was found by a second project failing to link, not by
# anything in the library that caused it - measured afterwards: instrumented
# object 3 gcov refs, the .so beside it 0, the same .so after a relink 3.
#
# So this is no longer a rule to remember. The release tree is not touched at
# all, there is nothing to clean up afterwards, and the hand-rolled shortcut
# that caused it - wanting the .gcov files, which this target used to destroy
# on its way out - no longer needs taking.
#

# profiles across runs, so a stale one from a previous source revision reports

# Flag stamps
####################################################################
# Each build tree carries the flag string it was built with. The stamp is
# rewritten only when that string differs -- written to a scratch file,
# compared, moved into place only on a difference -- so its mtime moves on a
# flag change and on nothing else. The object rules above depend on it.
#
# This replaces listing `Makefile` as a prerequisite, which was too broad (a
# comment-only edit recompiled everything) and too narrow (a command-line
# override such as `make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-O2` changes no file's mtime and so was
# invisible).
#
# These rules sit at the end of the file for two reasons. A rule's target
# expands when make reads the line, so a stamp rule above its own OBJ_DIR
# definition has an empty target: not an error, just a rule that silently does
# not exist. And the first target in a makefile is the default goal, so a stamp
# rule above `all:` makes a bare `make` build the stamp and nothing else.
# Each stamp must record the variables its own recipes expand, not the ones
# they are derived from. The release stamp recorded $(CFLAGS) while the
# library objects compile with $(LIB_CFLAGS); changing a flag that lives only
# in LIB_CFLAGS -- -fvisibility=hidden, -DGAUD_BUILD -- then moves no recorded
# string and rebuilds nothing. Measured in model, whose stamp had exactly that
# defect: 0 compiles, where naming Makefile as a prerequisite had rebuilt all
# 10. That is strictly worse than having no stamp, because a rebuild that does
# not happen looks exactly like a build that was already current. Arm the null
# case before believing a 0 here.
#
# The compiler belongs in the string too. `make CC=clang` is a command-line
# override that changes every object and no file's mtime, which is precisely
# the case these stamps exist for.
#
# The check is mechanical and is not yet automated here: for each rule guarded
# by a stamp, every $(VAR) its recipe expands must appear in that stamp. model
# runs it from tools/check-lists.py, which is where to take it from when this
# library has a second list worth checking.

# `-MMD -MP` is in this string literally, and it is the one flag here that is not

#
#   - The rule above the stamps says every flag a guarded recipe passes belongs in
#     its stamp, and these are flags the recipe passes.
#   - Without it, adding the depfile flags to the recipe moves nothing in this
#     string, so no existing tree rebuilds - and a fuzz object compiled before the
#     change still has no `.d`, so it goes on ignoring header edits forever. The
#     fix would be armed only for someone who happened to run `make fuzz-clean`.
#     Putting the flags here makes the stamp differ exactly once, which rebuilds
#     the tree that needs it and then stays quiet.
#
# The release and ASan stamps have the same omission and it costs nothing there,
# because those trees have carried depfiles since they were written. Adding the
